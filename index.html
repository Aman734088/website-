         <p class="sectionsubtag small-text">In the 18th century, Salzmann, German clergyman,
              opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises, including running and swimming.
               Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in 1825, Doctor Beck, a German immigrant,
                established the first gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose
                 interest in doing the same exercises, partly because of age. 
                 Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming. 
                 Some gym activities can be done by 6 to 8-year-olds while age 16
                  has been considered mature enough for boxing and horseback riding.

        <p class="sectionsubtag small-text">One of the causes most prevalent
             in the developing world is urbanization. As more of the population moves to cities,
              population over-crowding, increased poverty, increased levels of crime,
               high-volumes of car traffic, low air quality and lack of parks,
                sidewalks and recreational sports facilities leads to a less active lifestyle.
            Physical inactivity is increasing or high among many groups in the population including:
             young people, women, and the elderly.
                 A 2005 population study in south Brazil showed physical inactivity during 
                 leisure time to be more prevalent among females and those living with a partner; 
                 with a positive correlation associated with age and number of cigarettes smoked,
                  and a negative correlation (decreased levels of physical inactivity) associated 
                  with years of formal education, body mass index, and increasing socioeconomic status.
            Studies in children and adults have found an association between the number
             of hours of television watched and the prevalence of obesity.A 2008 meta analysis
              found that 63 of 73 studies (86%) showed an increased rate of childhood obesity 
              with increased media exposure, and rates increasing proportionally to time spent watching television.
            Another cause in the case of children is that physical activity in activities
             from self-propelled student transport, physical education, and organized
              sports is declining in many countries.

        <p class="sectionsubtag small-text"> A home gym can be a worthwhile investment.
             We are all busy people and most of us are pretty good at finding reasons
              not to go to the gym. But keeping active is so important. Not only for weight loss,
               but it has a whole host of other health benefits too, from strong bones and muscles,
                to combating stress and anxiety. So, how exactly do you “build” a gym?
                 And how do you know which equipment is best, so you don’t waste your money
                  on the latest fad which will become a clothes horse in a few months.It’s impossible to
                   get everything you need from just one piece of kit. We all get bored of doing 
                   the same thing and your body gets used to doing an exercise, so it’s good to rotate
                    equipment and try new exercises to mix things up. Start by doing a thirty minute
                     workout at least three times per week. You can gradually build the length of time 
                     you’re exercising, the intensity (speed/weights), or number of days you exercise as 
                     you advance. And why not invite a friend over to try out your new home gym, so you
                      can motivate each other? Remember, you don’t need to buy everything at once to be
                       able to workout. You can just get a few of the essentials to get you started,
                        and gradually build up your gym as you get into your new exercise routine.
